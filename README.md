The Agriculture sector is the backbone of our country.It provides a living
for the vast majority of India’s inhabitants, but it only accounts for 15%
of the country’s GDP. In comparison to other countries, our country’s crop
yield is quite poor. This could be one of the reasons for India’s increased
suicide rate among marginal farmers. Another cause for this is that farmers
do not plan their crops properly.Another reason for this situation is that
farmers frequently make incorrect crop selection decisions, such as planting
in the wrong season or picking a crop that would not yield much for the
particular soil. Incorrect crop selection will always result in a lower yield. It
is difficult to survive if the family is entirely dependent on this revenue. In
this paper, we offer a model that addresses these concerns.
